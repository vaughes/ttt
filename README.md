Noughts and crosses

A player decides whether to play X or 0.
A player can play in any square.
Players take turns to play, e.g X is followed by 0.
Once a square has been played in, it cannot be played in again.
The winner is the first to achieve three in a row.
If all tiles are filled without getting three in a row, it is a draw.
